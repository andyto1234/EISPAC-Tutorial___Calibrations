# EIS Calibration Tutorial using EISPAC in Python

This repository provides a tutorial on calibrating Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) data using the EISPAC package in Python. The tutorial covers two calibration methods:

1. Warren et al. 2014 calibration
2. Del Zanna et al. 2023 calibration (currently in review)

## Tutorial Contents

The tutorial covers the following topics:

1. Reading and fitting EIS data using EISPAC
2. Retrieving and applying the Warren et al. 2014 and Del Zanna et al. 2023 calibration functions
3. Comparing the calibrated intensity maps with the default EISPAC preflight calibration
4. Comparing the calibration results between IDL and Python implementations

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to calibrate EIS data using different methods and compare the results between Python and IDL implementations.
